The Art of the Nerd Snipe: How to ask questions that people want to answer

Have you ever struggled to get answers to what should have been simple questions? Have you ever had a forum post had its requests completely ignored? There is a subtle art to asking for help in a way that grabs people's interest and makes them want to get involved in what you are working on, and it only takes a moment to do.

Include the question: don't just ping them

The first and most important key to asking a good question is to include the question in your message. This seems simple, but so often that crucial detail is left out of the request. Without any info about the request, it is very hard to prioritize and allocate time, which makes it much less appealing to volunteer.

Bad question: "Hello!"

Be respectful of people's time! They can't triage a hello. https://nohello.net/en/ Instead of giving them the tools to begin thinking about the problem whenever they are able to get to the message, this just pulls them away from what they were working on. It then makes them wait on hold until you see their response and actually type out the question.

Bad question: "Any change management experts around?"

Instead of being able to give you pointers on your actual request, this message style just limits your potential helpers. It implies that you can't be bothered to describe your problem, and makes it very unappealing to volunteer to help. The problem may not even need that expertise. Don't just ask to ask; ask your question!

Good question: "How do you un-do a change management document once it was submitted? I saved some changes I didn't mean to."

Presenting your question, even just at a high level, gives the people you are talking to an incredible amount of information. It lets them know the scope of the problem, lets them immediately start thinking about next steps, and also gives them what they need to point you to the right people if they don't know themselves. Other people can triage the severity and get a good idea of the time commitment, even just from this, making it much easier to volunteer to help.



Include context: what goal are you trying to achieve?

You've thought about what you are working on for some time now, but the people you are reaching out to likely have not. Without a little bit of detail on what you are trying to accomplish, your question might not make sense. Worse, a loew-level question in a vacuum can often lead away from the solution to your problem, if you aren't on the right track.


Bad question: "What is the best chatGPT plugin for COBOL?"

In order to give a good answer to this, a ton of follow-up questions are needed to have any idea what is going on. Why COBOL? Why chatGPT? What do they mean by "plugin"? There's not enough to go off of, and digging for better info is not a simple task. Would-be helpers are asked to do a lot of work just to understand what this kind of question is asking. This is sometimes referred to as the XY problem, where a specific question about an attempted solution leads to bad results, since WHY you are trying to do something specific is key to the answer you need (but often left out). https://xyproblem.info/


Good question: "Hi! Can you help me find someone who knows about COBOL? The client believes it is a good fit for their new chatbot app."

This question lets your convo partner know what you are thinking about and why. Not only do they know the specific question, but they have a good idea how you arrived where you are, and why you are thinking about the solution you are asking about. This lets them know you are taking the problem seriously nd have thought about it. (If you aren't, why should they?). It saves an incredible amount of time for the people who would assist you, making it much easier and more interesting to get involved.



Describe what you observed, not your guess as to the problem

Often times, the key to answering the question you have is tied to what you saw happen. If you don't share that, and instead give an interpretation of the cause, it often ends up hiding critical information. Your assistants will have to ask about it anyway, so it is worth summarizing in your question.

Bad question: "The laptop is broken. It's not working no matter what I do."

This could mean almost anything. Is the wifi turned off? is the battery dead? Is the screen disconnected? This person is more interested in venting frustration than sharing helpful info, which makes it very hard to be excited to help.

Good question: "I get this error message whenever I try to update my computer: ..."

This question immediately provides exactly what was seen to go wrong, and context for what was happening at the time. It lets others know exactly what the stakes are, and what kind of knowledge you need to offer to help. It also provides some key things to Google if you don't know the answer already! This question was asked by someone who respects the people who they are asking for help.


Be part of the collaboration to find the solution! If you are a partner in the journey, and you share your goal and what you have seen and tried, other problem-solving people will flock to you. A little effort in crafting a good question will be paid back tenfold in others willing to put in the effort to assist you. With some simple phrasing tricks and providing a few details, you will find that there are many people who can't help but stop what they are doing to engage with the interesting mystery you brought up. You have a choice: do you put off would-be helpers with lazy questions, or do you hook them so hard they'll still be thinking about that cool problem days later? Choose carefully!




------------


Include history: What have you tried already?
- who have you spoken to?
- what did you try and discover didn't work?
  To ask for help in good faith, you need to take a pass at the problem first. RTFM, google your problem, look to see if someone has solved it already.


Good example
I've gone though the documentation for XXX, but I can't find anything about ...

bad example
Does COBOL have chatgpt integration?



DO NOT JUST SAY "HELLO". 
Do not ask if you can ask https://dontasktoask.com/
Include them in the goal

    Don't just ask for help with the tiny step you are on, include context https://xyproblem.info/
    Be clear you are planning to be part of the investigation, a partner, not a demandee

    try things first
        RTFM
        Google your problem
        don't just be instantly helpless

    Mention what you have already tried in your question
        This brings helpers along for the ride
        Avoids duplicating effort: be respectful of volunteer's time

    Describe what you observe, not your guess as to what is going wrong

    You will get answers that reflect your question's quality.
        Hasty questions that are not thought-out will often get hasty answers
        Pointing blame will immediately turn of readers
